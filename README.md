# Discord.js-Notification-System Infomration

This is a notification system that allows you to notify people who have a certain role via DM's with a bot. In addition, you can sticky a message to a certain channel and it will stick there until you unstick it. Which these are perfect ways to direct information out to people. In order for the command to work you have to do the following;

**[PREFIX]notify**
**!sticky**
**!unsticky**
